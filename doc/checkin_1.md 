# How youâ€™ve addressed prior feedback
### Is there one (or more) histone variants that you would target first?
Yes, we will focus on H2AFY first.
### Provide IDs/links to specific PDMR and TCGA datasets
We will only use TCGA datasets this time. The link: https://livejohnshopkins-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/yhuan279_jh_edu/Egg3oIt1YdNEnxVyetSnKXQBkvdcYdGixwxKkPMXpUFPBA?e=5yaMEl
The expression of each patients are merged together.
### Do you have a GSEA package in mind such as http://bioconductor.org/packages/fgsea or https://bioconductor.org/packages/clusterProfiler?

# Struggles you are encountering and questions you would like advice on
- Some histone variants are highly expressed across almost all cancer types in our datasets, but the surviving curve may not have any difference. we want to find a biological explaination for it.
